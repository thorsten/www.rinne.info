## 1. Requirements

You need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system. It was tested with version 16 and newer.

## 2. Quick Start

First, install needed dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

Then, run webpack

   The `dev` command will start a dev server and watch for code changes in JS and SCSS files. Hot reloading is enabled,
   so that any change will be visible in your browser as you type.

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   For production usage, run the `build` command and everything you need gets packed together into the `public`
   directory. You can upload the content to any hosting provider, without further modifications.

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 3. Credits

This is based on the boilerplate written by [Dominik Hanke](https://github.com/noreading/bootstrap5-webpack-boilerplate).
